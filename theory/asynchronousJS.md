async code starts something now and comes back to it and continues the rest of the script

async methods:
  * callbacks (g00d),
  * Promises (better),
  * Generators (awesome);

  Ajax Requests:
    * communicate with a server by making a http request
    * no need to reload the page
    * stands for: Asynchronous Javascript And XML
